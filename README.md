## Installation

This plugin can be installed using the Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool (BRAT) which can be installed from the community plugin list. With BRAT installed and active, you can install Indentation Guides by adding `mgmeyers/obsidian-indentation-guides` as a beta plugin.

## Styling

Indentation guides are styled with relatively simple CSS, and can be overriden by themes and CSS snippets. See [styles.css](styles.css) for relevant classes.

Alternatively, you can use [style setting plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) to ajust horizontal positon (in reading and editing view) and to customize the color (when active and inactive).
